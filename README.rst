open-project.ch breakout boards collection (SMD to DIL adapters)
================================================================

This is a collection of breakout boards (or SMD to DIL adapters) for commonly used surface mounted device (SMD) components. All breakout boards are made to fit a standard DIL package with a width of 600mil. The boards are available as `KiCad <http://kicad-pcb.org>`_ files and as PDF files for easy printing. See `open-project.ch <http://open-project.ch>`_ for more details.
